### Chicken

Open Program.cs. Add the missing code to Chicken and Egg so the following are satisfied:

* Chicken implements the IBird interface.
* A Chicken lays an egg that will hatch into a new Chicken.
* Eggs from other types of birds should hatch into a new bird of their parent type.
* Hatching an egg for the second time throws a System.InvalidOperationException.
